# harbor-service

![harbor-service](harbor-service.png)

A RESTful api written in [Go](https://go.dev) for upserting Harbors.

It aims to show how to handle JSON streaming in an efficient way.

## key features

- I've generated the basic REST API structure using an open source project of mine, [go-templates](https://github.com/tiagomelo/go-templates).
- Uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for saving Harbors in disk.
- Uses [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for HTTP routing.
- Implements custom middleware.
- Input validation with [validator](https://github.com/go-playground/validator).
- Database migrations handled by [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).
- API documentation through [go-swagger](https://github.com/go-swagger/go-swagger).
- Uses [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint).
- Uses [govulncheck](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/vuln/cmd/govulncheck) for known vulnerabilities check.
- Ensures 100% test coverage, including both unit and integration tests.

## dependencies

- [Go](https://go.dev)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com), for linter, swagger, and if you want to run the dockerized version of the service

## endpoint

`POST api/v1/harbors`

This endpoint receives a JSON object containing multiple harbor entries, where each key is the UN/LOCODE and the value is the harbor's details. It processes the input **streaming-style** for efficiency, ensuring that even large files do not exhaust memory.

It performs 

Sample input:

```
{
    "AEAJM": {
        "name": "Ajman",
        "city": "Ajman",
        "country": "United Arab Emirates",
        "alias": [],
        "regions": [],
        "coordinates": [
            55.5136433,
            25.4052165
        ],
        "province": "Ajman",
        "timezone": "Asia/Dubai",
        "unlocs": [
            "AEAJM"
        ],
        "code": "52000"
    },
    "AEAUH": {
        "name": "Abu Dhabi",
        "coordinates": [
            54.37,
            24.47
        ],
        "city": "Abu Dhabi",
        "province": "Abu ZÂ¸aby [Abu Dhabi]",
        "country": "United Arab Emirates",
        "alias": [],
        "regions": [],
        "timezone": "Asia/Dubai",
        "unlocs": [
            "AEAUH"
        ],
        "code": "52001"
    }
}
```

output:

```
{"message":"harbors upserted"}
```

## running it

### without Docker

```
make run PORT=<desired_port>
```

### with Docker

```
make docker-run PORT=<desired_port>
```

#### calling the endpoint via cURL

You can use the provided [ports.json](ports.json).

```
$ curl -v "http://localhost:<port>/api/v1/harbors" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @ports.json
* Host localhost:<port> was resolved.
* IPv6: ::1
* IPv4: 127.0.0.1
*   Trying [::1]:<port>...
* Connected to localhost (::1) port <port>
> POST /api/v1/harbors HTTP/1.1
> Host: localhost:<port>
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
> Content-Type: application/json
> Content-Length: 501544
> 
* upload completely sent off: 501544 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: Sat, 22 Feb 2025 00:39:55 GMT
< Transfer-Encoding: chunked
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
{"message":"harbors upserted"}
```

The `--data-binary` flag ensures that data is sent exactly as it is, without modifications, making it ideal for streaming large JSON payloads. Unlike `--data`, which may alter line breaks or spaces, `--data-binary` preserves the original structure, preventing unwanted formatting issues. This is especially useful for APIs that process bulk data or real-time streams, ensuring the request is handled as a continuous, unmodified data stream.

## running tests

```
make test
```

## coverage report

```
make coverage
```

then, the coverage report will be opened in your browser:

## api documentation

Two files hold api's documentation: [doc.go](http/doc/doc.go) and [api.go](http/doc/api.go).

To re-generate [swagger.json](http/doc/swagger.json),

```
make swagger
```

To view it on a browser,

```
make swaggger-ui
```

then visit `localhost:8080`:
